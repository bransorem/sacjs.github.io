      description: >
        Promises can drastically improve the way we are writing our async code. They give us back the ability to centralize our error handling and return values from functions like we can in synchronous code.


        We'll be going over what Promises are, what they can do, and how we can start using them.


        If we have time, we will then take a look at the future async / await features that are making their way into the spec.

      description: >
        Let's have some fun heading in to the holiday season!


        A lightning talk is a short presentation lasting only a few minutes. Being of such short length, it is a great way for new speakers to try their hand at presenting to our group. For more experienced speakers, it is a way to work on making a more concise presentation.


        We are accepting talk topics on _anything_! If you can talk about it for five minutes, that likely means that you are passionate about it. We want to hear about your passions! You can talk about Javascript, web technology, Java 6, bicycle repair, or flower arranging!

      description: >
        We have been using JavaScript toolkits like jQuery for nearly a decade to make manipulating the DOM easier as we create our highly-interactive web apps. New features in HTML5 & CSS3 should’ve made old development strategies obsolete, and yet we’re still using jQuery to do things better suited for HTML5 & CSS3. Why? Well, old habits die hard.

        Chris Minnick and Eva Holland are the co-founders of [WatzThis?](https://twitter.com/WatzThisCo) and the co-authors of [Coding with JavaScript For Dummies](http://www.amazon.com/Coding-JavaScript-Dummies-Chris-Minnick/dp/1119056071/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1431562002&sr=8-1&keywords=chris+minnick), which has an official world-wide release date of June 1, 2015. The book, and it's accompanying Codecademy course, teaches beginners how to program web applications using JavaScript. This is the first new JavaScript book in the For Dummies series since 2004 -- so, needless to say, this book has been a long time coming and it brings the state of JavaScript For Dummies up to modern standards.
