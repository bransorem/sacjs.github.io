In early October, the Sacramento Angular Meetup group was founded and they are
kicking off their meetups this week at Hacker Lab.

During this meetup they will introduce AngularJS along with some examples of
Angular code in action. If you don't know what AngularJS is, this meetup is
for you! Beginners welcome!

Complimentary food & drinks will be served before the meeting.

Interested in joining us? RSVP on their
[Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/Sacramento-Angular-Meetup/events/211909052/).

Since SacJS is all about building a community around Javascript, we want to show
our support to the Sacramento AngularJS group. This is their first event so we
want to do everything we can to make it a success.

So join us in learning about [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) while
supporting the burgeoning Sacramento JavaScript scene!
