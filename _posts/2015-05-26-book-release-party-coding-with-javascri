This month, we will be having a book release party to celebrate local authors
[Chris Minnick](https://twitter.com/chrisminnick) and Eva Holland!

<!-- more -->

Chris Minnick and Eva Holland are the co-founders of [WatzThis?](https://twitter.com/WatzThisCo) and the co-authors of [Coding with JavaScript For Dummies](http://www.amazon.com/Coding-JavaScript-Dummies-Chris-Minnick/dp/1119056071/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1431562002&sr=8-1&keywords=chris+minnick), which has
an official world-wide release date of June 1, 2015. The book, and it's
accompanying Codecademy course, teaches beginners how to program web
applications using JavaScript. This is the first new JavaScript book in the For
Dummies series since 2004 -- so, needless to say, this book has been a long
time coming and it brings the state of JavaScript For Dummies up to modern
standards. 

Chris and Eva will talk and answer questions about the 6-month planning,
writing, and editing process that resulted in this book; they'll have copies of
the book available for sale (and maybe for raffling); and they'll talk about
their upcoming JavaScript for Kids For Dummies book.

SacJS expects all speakers and attendees to follow our
[Code of Conduct](http://sacjs.com/code-of-conduct/).

In addition to our main speakers, anyone who wants to speak at the end of our
meetup will have a chance during our 15-seconds of Fame segment. Its a fun and
easy way to shake off any reservations you may have about public speaking. We
would love to hear from you so start thinking about what you'd like to say!

We will also have our usual round of giveaways and time to meet-and-greet after
the event. 

Food will be provided by our sponsor [TEKSystems](http://www.teksystems.com/)
(thanks Chelsea!) and liquid refreshments will be provided by the
[Rocket Department](http://rocketdepartment.com/) (thanks Emma!)

If you would also like to sponsor or speak at one of our events, please contact
us on [GitHub](https://github.com/sacjs/sacjs.github.io/issues),
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/sac_js), or
[Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/The-Sacramento-Javascript-Meetup/). Remember, we love sharing any ideas that come from our Sacramento tech community. If you have a
non-technical talk, that's ok! We'd love to have you anyway!
