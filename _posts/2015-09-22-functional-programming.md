This month, [Brad Compton](https://github.com/Bradcomp) we will be introducing
us to the wonderous world of functional programming!

<!-- more -->

* What is FP and why we should care
* Function purity and side effects
* First class functions & lambdas
* Currying and partial application
* Lists and list processing (map, filter, folds, etc.)
* Higher order functions and function composition
* Lazy evaluation
* Tools and libraries

After our presentations, we will have a few freebies to give away and we will
have our "15-seconds of Fame" segment where anyone can make a quick
presentation to the group. And as always, stick around afterwards to hang out,
mingle, ask questions, and meet new people!
