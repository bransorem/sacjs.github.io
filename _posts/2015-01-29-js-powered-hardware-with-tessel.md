Interested in the "Internet of Things" but don't have time to learn yet another
language? Intimidated by terminology like "GPIO", "ARM", and "3.4v headers"?
Wish you could leverage your knowledge of web technologies in the real world?

Well now there is no excuse! Come join us for a fun, newcomer-friendly, and FREE
[Tessel](https://tessel.io) hackathon!

<!-- more -->

The [Tessel](https://tessel.io) is a Javascript-powered microcontroller. That
means you can use your knowledge of web technologies to control things in the
real world! LEDs, servo motors, accelerometers, RFID readers, there are many
possibilities!

But don't be scared!

The [Tessel](https://tessel.io) is very user-friendly, so even if you've never
held a microcontroller before, we can promise that you'll leave having at least
turned an LED on and off with Javascript! And even if you stumble, you'll have
aa great time trying!

Not only has Technical Machine been kind enough to lend us 40 hackathon kits,
but co-founder and co-creator of Tessel, [Tim Ryan](https://twitter.com/timcameronryan),
will be on hand to give a quick overview of the Tessel ecosystem as well as
provide on-site technical support.

All hardware will be provided! You only need to bring a laptop with
[NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) installed and yourself!

Space is limited to the number of Tessel devices we will have on-hand so be
sure to RSVP ASAP!
