Join us as we welcome Google engineer and JSConf EU organizer
[Malte Ubl](https://twitter.com/cramforce) to Sacramento!

<!-- more -->

Malte will be sharing lessons he learned while working on YouTube.com and
Google+ in his talk "Tradeoffs in server side and client side rendering"

We are still working on bringing in a second speaker, so if you have a talk in
mind, please let us know!

After our presentations, we will have a few freebies to give away and we will
have our "15-seconds of Fame" segment where anyone can make a quick
presentation to the group. And as always, stick around afterwards to hang out,
mingle, ask questions, and meet new people!
