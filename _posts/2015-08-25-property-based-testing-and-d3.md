This month we will be learning about Property Based Testing from
[Hardy Jones](http://twitter.com/st58) and [Jeff Bennett](http://twitter.com/DigitalSplash) will tell us about his experiences with [D3](http://d3.org/).

<!-- more -->

After our presentations, we will have a few freebies to give away and we will
have our "15-seconds of Fame" segment where anyone can make a quick
presentation to the group. And as always, stick around afterwards to hang out,
mingle, ask questions, and meet new people!
