Join us as we welcome Microsoft Virtual Reality Evangelist 
[Liv Erickson](https://twitter.com/misslivirose) to Sacramento!

<!-- more -->

Liv will discuss the emerging support from the VR and web communities for WebVR, a new API emerging to support writing VR-enabled websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We'll be taking a look at existing applications for virtual reality on the web, the benefits of WebVR, and how to get started with the available tools and libraries for browser-based virtual reality written in JavaScript.

And if we're lucky, we might get to try out an Oculus Rift!

After our presentations, we will have a few freebies to give away and we will
have our "15-seconds of Fame" segment where anyone can make a quick
presentation to the group. And as always, stick around afterwards to hang out,
mingle, ask questions, and meet new people!
