In lieu of an official BeerJS event, we are going to be supporting our
associates in the [Famo.us community](http://www.meetup.com/Sacramento-Famo-us-Meetup/)
by attending their inaugural meetup.

Interested in joining us? RSVP on their
[Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/Sacramento-Famo-us-Meetup/events/209100622/).

Since SacJS is all about building a community around Javascript, we want to show
our support to the Sacramento Famou.us group. This is their first event so we
want to do everything we can to make it a success.

So join us in learning about [Famo.us](http://famo.us/), see amazing demos, win
prizes (Famo.us has given them a pile of shirts and stickers to give everyone),
and drink free beer (generously provided by
[Red Rabbit Kitchen and Bar](https://theredrabbit.net/)). There may even be
special visitors from Famo.us!
