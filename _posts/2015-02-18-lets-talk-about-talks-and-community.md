With our Javascript community here in Sacramento being so new, now is a great
time to learn a bit more about community tech events, being a presenter, and
getting out and forging new friendships with your peers!

<!-- more -->

[Rdio's](http://www.rdio.com) [Bryan Hughes](https://twitter.com/nebrius),
founder of [NodeBotsSF](https://twitter.com/nodebotssf), is going to kick
things off by speaking about, well, speaking! Learn what it takes to put
yourself out there and present your ideas to your community!

Next up, [Emily Rose](https://twitter.com/nexxylove) will be regaling us with
the story of how [Oakland DanceJS](https://twitter.com/oaklanddancejs) got
started and will offer you a healthy dose of encouragement to helping our own
community grow, or maybe even get you to start your own!

Closing out the evening will be [Benjamin Coe](https://twitter.com/benjamincoe),
from [NPM](https://twitter.com/npmjs) who will tell you how and why you should
be using a package manager for your next Javascript project.
