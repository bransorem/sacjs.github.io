SacJS is proud to support another Sacramento JS-community event.

Ready to get really excited about Famous? Wednesday, November 12th @ 7pm, come
to Hacker Lab and enjoy Famous demos and live coding by Shu Liu, the creator of
Famous University. It's free, there will be beer, and you couldn't have a
better teacher. Hope to see you there!
