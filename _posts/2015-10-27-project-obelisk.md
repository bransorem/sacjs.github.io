This month, [Andy Axton](https://twitter.com/andyaxton) we will be showing us
how he used advanced Javascript APIs and frameworks to prototype a real-world
art installation.

<!-- more -->

Stumped as to how to develop LED animation logic for hardware that did not yet
exist, Andy Axton will show us how he used Javascript to prototype, and
subsequently build, Rocket Department's art installation that was showcased at
this summer's TBDFest. His talk will include examples of the Web Audio API as
well as the WebGL framework three.js.

After our presentations, we will have a few freebies to give away and we will
have our "15-seconds of Fame" segment where anyone can make a quick
presentation to the group. And as always, stick around afterwards to hang out,
mingle, ask questions, and meet new people!
