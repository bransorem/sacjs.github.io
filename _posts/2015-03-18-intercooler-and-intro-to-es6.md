It's time for another installment of SacJS! This time we are keeping things
local with two talks from fellow Sacramentans.

First up will be Carson Gross, CEO and Co-Founder of LeadDyno, who will show
off his Javascript library that allows you to add AJAX functionality with simple
HTML5 Attributes!

And closing out the evening will be Mike Piccolo, from NewLeaders.com out of
Folsom, who will give us an Intro to ES6: What is it and why you should care.

After our presentations, we will also have a few freebies to give away. And as
always, stick around afterwards to hang out, mingle, ask questions, and meet
new people!
