We are going to start throwing around some ideas for our very first formal
technical meetup so we'd love to have you out to join the conversation. Having
said that, it is still BeerJS so anything in the world of Javascript is fair game!

BeerJS is an informal way to for like minded Sacramentoans to gather around and
chat about Javascript over a nice, tasty, beverage.
