Hello, and thanks for visiting SacJS, Sacramento's very own Javascript meetup
group!

We are excited to start building a great community focused on all things
Javascript. That means learning about new standards like [ES6][es6], frameworks
like [Polymer][polymer] and [React][react], tooling like
[Browserify][browserify] and [GulpJS][gulp], robotics like [NodeBots][nodebots]
and [Johnny-Five][johnnyfive], libraries like [D3][d3] and [Lodash][lodash],
conferences like [JSConf][jsconf] and [JSFest][jsfest], and everything else
that is out there or yet to be created!

<!-- more -->

But in order to build a community and start learning and teaching about new
things, we need one very important thing.

**People!**

That means you! So follow us on Twitter at [@Sac_JS](http://twitter.com/sac_js)
and at least say hello!

And while we're getting to know each other, do you:

* Have an idea for a talk?
* Know of a sponsorship opportunity?
* Have an ideal location to host a meetup?

Then we definitely want to talk with you!

In the meantime, be sure to follow our sister organization,
[@BeerJS_SAC](http://twitter.com/beerjs_sac) for fun, informal gatherings at
Sacramento's favorite watering holes!
