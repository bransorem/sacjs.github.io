We're changing things up a bit for this installation of BeerJS!

Instead of an evening of cold and tasty brews, we'll be meeting up for a
_morning_ of _hot_ and tasty brews!

<!-- more -->

So join us at the **downtown** Temple Coffee for people and <strike>beer</strike>
*coffee* and Javascript!

Interested in joining us? RSVP on
[Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/{{ page.meetup_group_name || site.meetup_group_name }}/events/{{ page.meetup_id }}/).

Have a question? Comment on our
[GitHub page]({{ page.github_issue_url }}) or
[send us a tweet](https://twitter.com/beerjs_sac)!

Just like BeerJS, CoffeeJS is an informal way to for like minded Sacramentans
to gather around and chat about Javascript over a nice, tasty, beverage.
