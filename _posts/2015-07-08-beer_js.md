    description: >
      BeerJS is an informal way for like-minded Sacramentans to gather around and chat about Javascript over a nice, tasty, beverage.


      As promised at our last meetup, we will have a limited number of BeerJS pint glasses to give out on a first come, first serve basis! And thanks to our sponsor TEKSystems, they'll come with a free beer in them!
