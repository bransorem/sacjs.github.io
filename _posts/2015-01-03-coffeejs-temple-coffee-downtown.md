We had such a good time at CoffeeJS in November that we've decided to do it
again!

So join us at the **downtown** Temple Coffee for people and coffee and
Javascript!

Just like BeerJS, CoffeeJS is an informal way to for like minded Sacramentans
to gather around and chat about Javascript over a nice, tasty, beverage.
